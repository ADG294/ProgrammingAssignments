Program Description:
This program will create a list of 30 words and phrases that will be used to identify if the user input is a spam
email or not.


Logical Steps:
1. Create list that holds all 30 spam words.
2. Create an input variable for users to input emails in order to validate them.
3. Use a for loop to iterate through the email and conditionals that will append every spam word found into a new list.
4. Add a conditional that will decide whether the email is spam or not.
5. Print spam score, whether the email is spam or not, and the new word list with each spam words found in the email.


Variables:
1. spam_words: A list of 30 spam words used to check the words from user emails.
2. e_mail: A string input variable that takes user emails as input.
3. count: This variable keeps track of every iteration.
4. word_list: This is the list of spam words found within the user emails.
5. spam_score: The number of spam words that is based assigned to the count variable that increments.
6. is_spam: This variable is used to decide whether the email is spam or not based on the spam_score variable.
7. word: This is a temporary variable used to iterate through the email, and is used with the lower() function to
   iterate through the spam_words list.


Functions:
1. Function Name: spam_message
    Description: Iterates through the user email and finds matches between the spam word list and the email and keeps
    track of how many spam words were in the email. After, it prints the spam score, whether it's a spam email or not
