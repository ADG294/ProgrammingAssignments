Program Description:
This program creates a list of user input with expenses
and then uses a loop to append each expense to the list.
After, this program uses the reduce function from the functools
package that adds the total expenses and calculates
the lowest and highest expenses then displays all expenses.



Logical Steps:
1. Create an empty list and variables that are null.
2. Create a while loop that while true loops until nothing is entered.
3. Create an input variable for users to input the name of expense.
4. Create a condition that if enter is pressed without input program resolves and exits.
5. Create an input variable for users to input the amount of expense.
6. Append amount to the list every iteration.
7. Use reduce method to apply our add function to the list.
8. Use reduce method to create a lambda function that finds the lowest expense from the list.
9. Use reduce method to create a lambda function that finds the highest expense from the list.
10. Print all  the expenses from the reduce functions.


Variables:
1. ex_list: Starts as an empty list that has expenses appended to it.
2. ex_result: Uses the reduce function to call the add function on ex_list.
3. u_in: User input for expense name.
4. u_amount: User input for expense amount.
5. r_min: Uses the reduce and lambda function to find the lowest expense.
6. r_max: Uses the reduce and lambda function to find the highest expense.


Functions:
1. Function Name: add
    Description: Adds x and y
    Parameters: x, y
    Returns: returns sum of x and y
2 Function Name: main
    Description: Executes program and calls the reduce function as well as the lambda functions and add function.
    Parameters: x, y
    Returns: returns x or y
