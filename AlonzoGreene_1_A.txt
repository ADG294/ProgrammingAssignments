Program Description:
This program has a specified amount of presale tickets that will update every time a buyer buys a ticket. Then the number of tickets remaining will be displayed. Tickets bought cannot exceed 4. After the app will display the total number of buyers.



Logical Steps:
1. Prompt user to enter how many tickets they want to buy.
2. Validate user input to check if it exceeds 4.
3. Check to see if amount of tickets is 0 so loop can break
4. Subtract user input from tickets then update each time as remaining tickets.
5. Increase buyer counter by each iteration until 0 tickets are left.
6. Print remaining tickets after each iteration.
7. Print total buyers.
