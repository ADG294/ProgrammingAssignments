Program Description:
This program will create a text file that will provide answers to random yes or no questions.
Then the program will read answers from the text file into a list.
Then the program will ask a yes or no question and prompt the user to quit when they're ready
then display the response.

Logical Steps:
1. Open and write file.
2. Initialize responses into variables.
3. Write those variables to the file.
4. Open same file in read mode.
5. Use read and split methods to read the responses and place them in a list then close the file.
6. Create a while loop that will prompt the user to ask a question and a random response will print or quit the game.
